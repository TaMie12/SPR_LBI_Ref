# SPR_LBI_Ref
This repository contains R code files to calculate SPR-based reference points for length-based indicators (LBIs): Lmax5% and Lmean

Example script: "calculate_SPR_LBI_Ref.R", to calculate specific SPR-based reference points adjust life history and fisheries selectivity parameter for the respective stock.
